# VoxTitle
A Motion plugin that generates titles inspired by Vox videos.

## Getting started
### Getting VoxTitle
Currently, the only way to get VoxTitle is to build it yourself using Xcode. See [Development](#development) for details.

### Using VoxTitle
Run the Wrapper app and the plugin should automatically register in Motion - open it up and you should see it in Generators panel. Drag it on to canvas and adjust parameters to your liking. Width and height have no effect - they just need to be big enough to fit the title otherwise it gets cropped.

## Development
### Dependencies
* Xcode 13+ with developer tools installed

### Getting sources
Run `git clone https://github.com/martin-ivanco/VoxTitle.git`

### Building
Building should be straight forward, just open up the Xcode project and build. There are two targets, but you should always build and run the Wrapper app if you want the plugin to be registered in Motion.

### Contributing
Currently not possible.
